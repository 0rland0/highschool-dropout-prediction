    "    - Pruning would be a counter-measure\n",

    "- If you have missing attribute values further work for completing them is needed (e.g. http://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jerzy/b24-miss.pdf )\n",
    "- Unstable: If you change the data a little bit you can possibly end up with a total different tree (using them within an ensemble method can solve this problem)\n",

There is also no single attribute value missing which makes it easy for us to just use decision trees. We don't need any preprocsessing. Also we have an offline problem where the data is not changing so we don't have the problem of unstable decision trees as we don't have data changes.\n",

    "1. As input we take the training data with its different features.\n",
    "2. We now try to split our data in homogenous chunks. For achieving that we look at each of our attributes how high is the information gain if we would split on this attribute. Information gain in laymans terms means how much I know more when I ask this question. If you compare it to the game where you have to guess who you are general questions like \"Am I alive / Am I a human / ...\" will give you a high information gain as it eliminates A LOT of possibilities who you could be. Asking more specific questions as \"Am I Michael Jackson/ Am I born in Berlin\" will give you a smaller information gain in the beginning.\n",
    "3. We choose the attribute with the highest information gain and split on that attribute which means we create a node which represents our attribute question (e.g. \"male?\"). This node is connected to the chunks where we divided our data.\n",
    "4. We then look at our chunkgs: If we have an entropy of 0 (no more information gain) in our chunk this will be a leaf. This leaf will also save the information to which class our test example belongs. If the entropy is higher then we have to split this chunk further in other chunks . To do this we just apply the same method from 2. and 3. with our chunk as data input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting works like playing a game where you have to answer questions. The questions are all encoded in the nodes. A question could be \"Age > 42\" or \"male?\". Your answer to that question leads you to a different node where either another questions waits for you or if there is no question anymore then you are in a leaf. The leaf is attached with a class which marks also the prediction class of your input. "
